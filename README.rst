Setup

..


Development
-----------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.org/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html



Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd spistresci
    celery -A spistresci.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.





Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``




Sentry
^^^^^^

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at http://getsentry.com or download and host it yourself.
The system is setup with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.



It's time to write the code!!!


Running end to end integration tests
------------------------------------

N.B. The integration tests will not run on Windows.

To install the test runner::

  $ pip install hitch

To run the tests, enter the spistresci/tests directory and run the following commands::

  $ hitch init

Then run the stub test::

  $ hitch test stub.test

This will download and compile python, postgres and redis and install all python requirements so the first time it runs it may take a while.

Subsequent test runs will be much quicker.

The testing framework runs Django, Celery (if enabled), Postgres, HitchSMTP (a mock SMTP server), Firefox/Selenium and Redis.


Deployment
----------

Docker
^^^^^^

See detailed `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_.
